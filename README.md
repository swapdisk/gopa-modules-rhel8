# Modules for in-place upgrade to RHEL8

The gopa-modules-rhel8 package provides a base set of modules to support in-place upgrade to RHEL8 using the [Gopa](https://github.com/swapdisk/gopa) framework. These modules require that [Zebra](https://github.com/swapdisk/zebra) playbooks are used to automate the preupgrade and the OS upgrade with the required [Leapp](https://leapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) integration. Additional modules can be introduced by building a [gopa-modules-custom] package tailored to suit the requirements of your environment.
